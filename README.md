Orbital Mechanics Toolkit üåå

A modular toolkit for simulating, analyzing, and visualizing orbital mechanics problems.

Overview

This project aims to build a flexible and extensible software framework for solving orbital mechanics problems. It will include modules for:

Simulating spacecraft motion in two-body and n-body environments

Propagating orbits using various numerical methods

Visualizing trajectories and maneuvers

Performing mission design and optimization tasks

The long-term goal is to create an open-source resource for students, researchers, and hobbyists interested in astrodynamics and space mission analysis.

Project Status

‚ö†Ô∏è Early Development:
This repository is currently in its planning phase.
No functional code has been added yet, but core concepts and architecture are being defined.

Follow this repo for updates as development begins!

Planned Features

Here‚Äôs what the project will eventually include:

Core Orbit Models: Keplerian elements, two-body motion, n-body perturbations

Numerical Propagation: Runge-Kutta, symplectic integrators, and adaptive methods

Orbital Maneuvers: Hohmann transfers, plane changes, low-thrust trajectories

Visualization Tools: 2D and 3D orbit plotting with Python-based libraries

Mission Analysis: Œîv budgets, phase planning, and targeting

Extensibility: Modular code structure to easily add new models and algorithms

Getting Started

While no code is available yet, here‚Äôs how you can prepare your environment:

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/orbital-mechanics-toolkit.git


(Optional) Set up a Python virtual environment:

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # Linux/Mac
venv\Scripts\activate      # Windows


Install basic dependencies (to be updated later):

pip install numpy matplotlib
